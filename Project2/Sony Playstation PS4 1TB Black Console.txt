had to replace my old ps4 for no other reason than it was too loud, always runs too hot. even after cleaning... clearly a design error from the start. Who pays ??? we do. still amazon did great getting it here fast............

I am very happy with this purchase. This ps4 came in new packaging and works perfectly. The only small complaint I have is that upon delivery a signature was required. I understand this is a requirement due to theft/insurance reasons but because I work during the day it makes it difficult to be here during the two/three hour window I was given for the delivery. I tried to reach out to the seller to see if the signature request could be removed and was told no. I also asked if this item could be delivered to a USP location near me (15 min) drive but was told that this location is not a package pickup location. Apparently the closest one to me was a two hour round trip drive which is a huge inconvenience. I ended up taking time off of work to be here for the delivery which was also a bit of an inconvenience. Otherwise I am overall happy with the item and is why I’m giving this a five star review. I’m just not happy with the delivery part.
