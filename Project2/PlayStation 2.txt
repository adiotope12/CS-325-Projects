need a back up, works well , not issues
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Seems to be very good condition. It's playing all the discs I've purchased from multiple sources. I purchased all required components and it's working as beautifully as the day it was probably sold to someone for $300 or more probably a pre-order.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Finally decided that I must own a Playstation 2 Console at an affordable price so I thought I would take a chance on second hand (Used) Unit. The seller shipped fast and I received the console in just four days.It was packed well.
The console was the older "Fat unit" which was just what i wanted.There was also a Sony wired controller that was included.
The console works flawlessly and ii am presently playing I C O. a very graphic beautiful game that puts the hardware through a good test. The only problem i had was the start button not working on the controller. This would have been a problem, but the price i paid for the console was fair and i was able to secure another controller from my neighbor. I am sure I will be able to fix the problem with the controller once i open it up and troubleshoot it. There are some games that play without needing the start button (GTA SA). Anyway it was probably an oversight and i don't hold it against the seller. A working console is what i set out for and i got it. I give the seller 5 stars.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The console works, which is ultimately the better of outcomes. I say that because I purchased multiple consoles from other sellers and all those consoles were dead on arrival. To have one actually work is incredible. However curb your enthusiasm on everything else. As you can see from the image, the console is filthy and the expansion cover port is missing. The missing cover isn't a big deal, but the dirt is causing the disc tray to jitter when it opens and I can hear the gears grind. I'm calling around to my local repair shops to see if there is anyone with the experience to open and clean it. I'm sure it's not a big deal for me to clean it, but after finally finding a console that works, I'm scared that even a wrong look will break it.

I'm very happy with my purchase it's a little dusty in the cartridge other then that I can't complain ðŸ™‚.
