This is my third count it third Ps3 My last two were serviceable but not great. My Last two systems were the super fat model systems, first one the disc drive died and overheated, second one overheated and blinking light of death. So i;d thought i'd try out the super slim models i originally wanted to get the limited edition "God Of War Super Slim Bundle" but it was near six hundred dollars, and i am not paying six hundred bucks on a ps3. I Spent the last several days uploading my games to the hard drive and started playing games and watching movies immediately, I was able to watch all my 3D based Blu-rays such as "Captain America: the Winter Soldier 3D" and "Spongebob Movie 2: Sponge out of Water 3D" and the 3D looks great! for some reason it just looks much better when play through the super slim system the only problem i have with system really is the "Youtube tv app" its really annoying annoying on my last two systems the app immediately connects to your youtube account, this one made subscribe to all of my channels again and i can't access my favorites or my liked videos that youtube app needs to be fixed. All in all the system is great and it works Beautifully.

ITS MY NOSTALGIA TYPING

I got it as a Christmas gift and I wanted one with the most GB, but despite what was said about the PS3 becoming cheaper after the PS4 comes out, that wasn't really the case. The price of this used one was fair and in "good condition" and on the outside it's shown very little wear so I was pleased about that. It also came with the necessary cables: A/V cord, adapter, USB controller charger, but with no manual or the original box. If that matters to you, which it usually does for me, find a seller that states that it comes with all that; but I accepted that it didn't come with these things, as you can view the manual online and look at videos for additional instructions. The controller, however, didn't hold a charge. The seller was even nice enough to send me another, but it didn't work as well. On the defense to the seller, it's hard to test a PS3 controller, unlike XBox 360 which uses an external battery that you can easily replace; the PS3's controller battery is internal with no knowledge of the life of the battery that was pre-owned. I ended up buying a new controller; and the original Sony controllers is still pretty pricey, but worth it in my opinion.

The seller once again was very gracious with my issues and reimbursed me for the faulty controller, so that was awesome. I knocked off one star because of the defective controller; but everything else - the console, cords and adapter was good. In conclusion, I've added a PS3 along with my other last-gens (XBox360/Wii) and was able to get it without breaking my friend's bank.

I recommend a PS3 for their great library of games and the seller who takes customer satisfaction seriously.
