The PS5 arrived fairly quickly and was in good shape upon arrival.

Now, regarding the console itself. The PS5 has a 'unique' design and is easily the biggest video game console I've ever seen. Due to its sheer size, I've had to place it horizontally within my media center where it's a bit difficult to access the disc drive.

The console came with a short HDMI 2.1 cable (capable of supporting 120fps if both your TV and the game you're playing support it too) and a generously sized USB cable for plugging in the controller or charging it. The game "Astro's Playroom" comes preinstalled and is an enjoyable, albeit short, game which you can use to familiarize yourself with the controller and console.

The console is advertised as having 825GB of storage, but only 667GB are usable so I'd recommend buying either an external HDD or a compatible nvme SSD for extra storage. PS5 games load extraordinarily fast and PS4 games enjoy faster loading times as well. Even XCOM2, which barely chugged along the PS4, runs smooth as butter. That said, install times are still rather long and it takes a while to transfer games to/from my HDD and SSD.

Despite claiming 8k on the box, I'm not aware of any games that are capable of natively supporting it. While the console does support 4k resolution and 120fps, you'll need to find games that do so too. While some games will run at 4k/60fps, others will have resolution vs. performance modes that'll sacrifice either resolution or framerate to ensure the game runs well.

The DualSense controller is appealing to the eye, has an ergonomic design, and the built-in haptic feedback is very pleasing to experience whenever a game supports it. My only complaint is that the battery life is somewhat poor and seems to charge slowly whenever plugged into something that's not a PS5. As such, I'd recommend charging the controller while playing a game or while the PS5 is in rest mode.

The PS5's Wi-Fi adapter is an improvement over the PS4's. It supports both 2.4ghz and 5ghz. I've noticed my downloads running faster on the PS5 than the PS4 while on the same network.

The PS5's backwards compatibility with PS4 games seems to work pretty well. Most games (especially ones with PS4 Pro patches) run extremely well and you can play them with a PS4 controller if you'd like. The only downside is that installing PS4 games seems to add to the PS5's "other" storage space. All games now have an install progress bar, and you can now separately delete DLC from games.

As far as problems go, I've found that the PS5's UI leaves something to be desired and I've occasionally run into small software problems, usually whenever installing, moving, or deleting games. Additionally, when I plugged in my external HDD for the first time, half of its game library was seemingly deleted. I now suspect that it's due to most of the games not being fully installed, something that I've now remedied on the PS5 and have not experienced again.

Overall, I'm pretty satisfied with my purchase so far and find it to be a worthwhile upgrade to my aging PS4. If you own physical PS4 games or prefer physical game copies in general, buy the PS5 disc edition. If you go all digital, get the cheaper digital edition. Aside from the presence (or lack thereof) of an optical drive, I'm not aware of any difference between them.

**Review for PlayStation 5 (PS5)**

The PlayStation 5 (PS5) has been a game-changer in the world of console gaming since its launch. After spending several months with the system, I can confidently say that it lives up to the hype. Here are my thoughts on its features, performance, and overall value.

**Design and Build Quality:**
The PS5 has a striking and modern design that stands out in any entertainment setup. Its sleek white and black aesthetic, combined with subtle LED lighting, gives it a futuristic look. The console is larger than its predecessor, but the design is well thought out, allowing for vertical or horizontal placement without compromising airflow.

**Performance:**
The performance of the PS5 is nothing short of impressive. Powered by a custom AMD processor, it delivers stunning graphics and fast load times, thanks to its ultra-high-speed SSD. Games load almost instantly, allowing you to dive right into the action without the frustrating wait times typical of previous consoles. The 4K gaming capability is also a significant upgrade, providing beautiful visuals that enhance the gaming experience.

**Game Library:**
The PS5 boasts an expanding library of exclusive titles and cross-platform games. Games like "Demon’s Souls," "Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart," and "Returnal" showcase the console's capabilities and provide immersive experiences that are hard to match. Backward compatibility with a large number of PS4 titles is also a huge plus, allowing players to enjoy their existing library with improved performance.

**DualSense Controller:**
One of the standout features of the PS5 is the DualSense controller. The haptic feedback and adaptive triggers add a new layer of immersion that enhances gameplay. You can feel the tension in the triggers during intense moments, and the subtle vibrations provide feedback that makes you feel more connected to the game. The built-in microphone and speaker are also convenient for quick chats without needing a headset.

**User Interface:**
The PS5’s user interface is sleek and intuitive, making it easy to navigate between games, settings, and the PlayStation Store. The Control Center provides quick access to essential features without interrupting gameplay, enhancing the overall user experience.

**Final Thoughts:**
Overall, the PlayStation 5 is an outstanding console that offers an innovative gaming experience. With its impressive performance, beautiful graphics, and unique controller features, it’s a must-have for both hardcore gamers and casual players alike. While the availability can be challenging at times, it's worth the effort to get your hands on one. If you’re looking for a console that pushes the boundaries of gaming, the PS5 is definitely the way to go.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The PlayStation 5 is an absolute powerhouse! From the moment I unboxed it, I was blown away by its sleek design and futuristic look. The performance is top-tier, with lightning-fast load times thanks to the SSD, and the graphics are stunning—games run smoothly in 4K with beautiful detail and fluid frame rates.

What really sets the PS5 apart is the DualSense controller. The adaptive triggers and haptic feedback add an immersive touch that makes every game feel more engaging, whether you're drawing a bow or feeling terrain shifts under your virtual car's tires. Backward compatibility is another plus, letting me enjoy my PS4 library with better performance.

The interface is clean and easy to navigate, and features like game hints and the ability to jump between activities make gaming more seamless than ever. Whether you're into single-player adventures or online multiplayer, the PS5 is a game-changer. Highly recommend it to anyone looking for the ultimate gaming experience!
